# Tumor Classification using a Vision Transformer

### Project Desc
Classifying MRI scans between tumor and healthy brains using a Vision Transformer. My first ever trial with all this AI stuff :)
<br/>

### Project Characteristics
* Has a from-scratch implementation of a Vision Transformer using hyperparameters from the original research paper
* Has an implementation with a Pretrained-Vit, which made the results better
